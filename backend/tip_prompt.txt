Can you explain to me how someone who is looking at images would confuse %s which someone has incorrectly guessed, for %s, which is what they should have guessed, and how they would differentiate them. Please answer in 3 sentences or less and give highly specific directions regarding the actual locations mentioned. Consider that this person is likely looking at images taken from a moving car and try to mention differences in places that would be visible from roads. Provide an even mix of indicators to identify the locations. Do not provide any excuses for your answers, simply get to the point and answer the question. If you reference an uncommon word or term define it clearly. Speak personally as if you are trying to teach someone how to identify the second location.
