I, the person prompting you, is a Geoguessr player. I looked at an image and identified a location as a guess for the one in the image I have seen. I have just guessed "%s" after looking at an image of "%s", the actual. The image of the actual location is attached. Try to think through my thought process for choosing the location I did and provide a short list of tips that could help me identify the specific details of the actual location that set it apart from my guess. When mentioning the guess location and actual location specify them.

When talking about a general noun provide exact examples of the nouns that each location has.
Avoid mentioning details you cannot verify:
* signs
* advertisments

Focus on differences between regions or countries, not specific addresses. Introduce variation in sentence structure into your output. Finally, and most important, your output should be short. Your entire output should be 5 sentences or less or 100 words or less, whichever comes first.
