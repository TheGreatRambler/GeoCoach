Can you explain to me how a player who is looking at images would confuse "%s" which this player has incorrectly guessed (make sure to call it the "guess"), for "%s", which is what the player should have guessed (make sure to call it the "actual location"), and how they would differentiate them.

Answer in 5 sentences or less and give highly specific directions regarding the actual locations mentioned. Consider that this player is likely looking at images taken from a moving car and try to mention differences in places that would be visible from roads. Provide an even mix of indicators to identify the locations. Do not provide any excuses for your answers, simply get to the point and answer the question. Emphasize differences between regions, not between roads or exact addresses. If you reference an uncommon word or term define it clearly. Speak personally as if you are trying to teach someone how to identify the second location. Do not specify the exact differences between each location, choose only the most relevant comparisons. 

The following image is the picture of the actual location that this player is trying to identify. Analyze it in order to provide help to the player but do not be very verbose.
